## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: ^19.1.1 (Latest version)
- **React DOM**: ^19.1.1
- **Vite**: ^7.1.7 (Build tool and dev server)
- **ESLint**: ^9.36.0 (Code linting)

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Choudhary4/React_Js2.O.git
   cd React_Js2.O
   ```

2. **Choose a lecture to start with:**

   ### For Lecture 01 (Hands-on Counter App)
   ```bash
   cd lecture01
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

   ### For Lecture 02 (Theory - React Fiber)
   ```bash
   cd lecture02
   # Read the comprehensive React Fiber guide in README.md
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

### Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

### Lint Code
```bash
npm run lint
```

## 🎓 Lecture Overview

### 📝 Lecture 01: React Fundamentals (Practical)
**Location**: `lecture01/`
- **Project Type**: Interactive Counter Application
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - React functional components and JSX
  - State management with `useState(23)`
  - Event handling (increment/decrement buttons)
  - Conditional logic (preventing negative values)
  - Modern development setup with Vite

### 📖 Lecture 02: React Fiber Architecture (Theoretical)
**Location**: `lecture02/`  
- **Content Type**: Comprehensive Guide & Documentation
- **Key Topics**:
  - React Fiber reconciliation engine
  - Incremental rendering vs synchronous rendering
  - Task scheduling and priority management
  - Performance optimization techniques
  - Error boundaries and improved error handling
  - Comparison: React 15 vs React 16+ architecture

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project covers essential React concepts:

1. **Functional Components**: Modern React component syntax
2. **React Hooks**: `useState` for state management
3. **Event Handling**: Button click events and function binding
4. **Conditional Logic**: Implementing business rules (non-negative counter)
5. **Component Lifecycle**: Understanding how state changes trigger re-renders
6. **Modern Development**: Vite setup for optimal development experience
